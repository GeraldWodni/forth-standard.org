## Author:

## Change Log:

## Problem:

> This states what problem the proposal addresses.

## Solution:

## Typical use: (Optional)

## Proposal:

> This should enumerate the changes to the document.

> For the wording of word definitions, use existing word definitions as a template. Where possible, include the rationale for the definition.

## Reference implementation:

> This makes it easier for system implementors to adopt the proposal. Where possible, the reference implementation should be provided in standard Forth. Where this is not possible because system specific knowledge is required or non-standard words are used, this should be documented.

## Testing: (Optional)
